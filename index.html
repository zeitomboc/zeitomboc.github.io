            <h3>CMSC 12 and CMSC 56</h3>
            <p class="category">My favorite CMSC subjects so far</p>
            <p>I had no experience in coding before college, and so when I took CMSC 12,
                I learned to appreciate and enjoy programming. I also had fun learning
                Discrete Mathematics, especially the topics under logic.

            <h3>ETHICS 1</h3>
            <p class="category">My favorite GE subject so far</p>
            <p>I enjoyed ETHICS 1 the most because the subject was more fun than stressful
                thanks to our professor, Sir Jet. I didn't enjoy learning Philosophy back
                in high school but Sir Jet was able to make it interesting.

            <h3>C</h3>
            <p class="category">My favorite programming language so far</p>
            <p>I think my favorite is C. I didn't think I would like it since it was less
                readable than python but I came to enjoy coding in C for some reason (and oddly,
                it's kind of aesthetically pleasing to me hahaha).
